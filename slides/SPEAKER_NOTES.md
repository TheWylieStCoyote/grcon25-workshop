## TROUBLESHOOTING QUICK REFERENCE

### Common GRC Issues:
1. **Missing throttle**: Add throttle block to simulation
2. **Type mismatch**: Check port colors, add type converter
3. **Sample rate mismatch**: Verify all rates match or use resampler
4. **No GUI appears**: Check generate options, use QT GUI
5. **Underruns (U)**: Reduce sample rate or simplify flowgraph

### Python Issues:
1. **Import errors**: Verify GNU Radio Python path
2. **Indentation**: Python is indent-sensitive
3. **Work function**: Must return number of items processed
4. **Port types**: Must match GRC definitions

### Hardware Issues:
1. **Device not found**: Check USB connection, drivers
2. **Overruns**: Reduce sample rate
3. **No signal**: Check antenna, gain settings
4. **Permission denied**: Add user to dialout/usrp groups

---

## KEY TEACHING POINTS

Throughout the workshop, emphasize:

1. **Start Simple**: Build complexity gradually
2. **Colors Matter**: Type matching via colors
3. **Throttle Always**: In simulation (never with hardware)
4. **Console Helps**: Read error messages
5. **Community Support**: You're not alone

## INTERACTION TECHNIQUES

- **Check Understanding**: "Thumbs up if this makes sense"
- **Peer Help**: "Help your neighbor if you're done"
- **Live Polls**: "Who got it working?"
- **Encourage Questions**: "What's confusing?"
- **Celebrate Success**: Applause for working flowgraphs
